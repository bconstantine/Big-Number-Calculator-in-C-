# Big-Number-Calculator-in-C-
This project is done together with Willy Awan as a submission for National Taiwan University of Science and Technology Object Oriented Programming class. User can type as long as integer or decimal as they like and the program will print up to 100 integers followed by 100 decimals, rounded. Program also worked by API where input is typed directly from inner class using C++ format. 

We do not own any music used inside the program.
